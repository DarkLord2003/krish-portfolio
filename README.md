# Krish Patel Portfolio

A React + Vite portfolio website for showcasing projects, skills, services, and contact details.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite (rolldown-vite)
- Plain CSS modules per component

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` starts the local dev server.
- `npm run build` creates a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the built app locally.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint checks.

## Project Structure

- `src/components` reusable UI sections.
- `src/pages` page composition (`Home`).
- `src/assets` images, icons, and resume.
- `src/styles` global styling tokens and base rules.

## Deployment Notes

- Add your final domain to canonical/OG metadata in `index.html`.
- Keep media optimized before deployment (profile image is the largest asset).
